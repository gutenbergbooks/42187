<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY.</a></h2>


<p>The increase in the number of our Catholic Colonies in Minnesota,
and the changes which population and other causes have
brought about, make it necessary to publish a revised edition of
the Immigration Pamphlet, issued by the Catholic Colonization
Bureau of Minnesota, in 1877.</p>

<p>We are pleased to notice the increased interest which is manifested
all over the country, by Catholics, in the matter of Catholic
immigration from the cities to the land.</p>

<p>The sympathy, aid, and words of cheer, we are continually receiving
from friends totally unconnected with our local work, assure
us of this pleasing fact; which we attribute, in a great measure,
to the honest, intelligent advocacy, and generous support our Catholic
newspapers have given to the question.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we are glad to gratefully acknowledge the liberal
support the Catholic editors have given to our work: the confidence
which they placed, from the very beginning, in the purity of
our motives and the soundness of our business arrangements, is an
indorsement of which we are justly proud.</p>

<p>They have recognized that our aim is to do good to the many;
and in all cases where our advice has been taken, our instructions
followed, our warnings heeded, we do not fear that we have injured
one.</p>

<p>The approbation of our co-religionists, conveyed to us from all
parts of the country, the success which God has been pleased to
give to our humble labors, are cheering guarantees that we are on
the right road; and we pray God that He will continue to bless our
efforts, enlighten us in our present task, and keep our ardor in the
cause we have espoused strictly within the bounds of truth.</p>

<p>It is an axiom that "they who own the soil own the country."</p>

<p>Happily, in this country, the people's title to the land is recognized,
they are invited to take possession of their own, and the
tall, luxuriant grasses of the broad prairie are the messengers it
sends forth from its virgin bosom, telling of the wealth it has in
store to reward honest, patient labor.</p>

<p>There is no angry contest here for the possession of the soil,
but there is, and should be, a noble, wise emulation among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
various races that have emigrated to these shores, for their just
portions of it. The surplus populations in our cities, the depression
of business, the scarcity of employment, the poverty, suffering
and discontent attending thereon, the magnitude of labor
strikes, and the dread of their repetition, have made the question
of immigration to the land from our over-crowded cities of pressing,
national interest. The policy of our people immigrating in
large numbers to the lands of the West, is no longer a theory to
discuss, but a necessity, calling for the active support of every
good, intelligent Catholic.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to review the many causes which have heretofore
retarded the immigration of our people to the land. Among
those causes was one which should endear them to every Catholic
heart, and which stands out in bright contrast to the irreligious
indifference of the age.</p>

<p><i>They feared that if they came West, they would be beyond the reach
of church and priest.</i></p>

<p>The danger of a Catholic settling in any of the Western States
now, and finding himself entirely isolated, by distance, from his
church, is scarcely to be apprehended, for the West has now its
handsome churches, its priests and Catholic schools; but it might
come to pass, that coming undirected, and without any Catholic
organization to which he might apply, the Catholic immigrant
might find himself settled in a locality inconveniently distant
from church and priest, and where he and his family would be
separated from Catholic associations.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, the religious welfare of those coming to
our colonies, was one of the main features to which Bishop Ireland
devoted his attention when organizing the Catholic Colonization
Bureau. Before the arrival of any of our immigrants, the rule
was established that whenever we opened a colony and invited our
people to it, the resident priest and church should go in with our
first settlers, be their number small or large. To this good rule
we attribute, to a great extent, not alone our success in bringing
settlers to our colonies, but likewise their general contentment in
their new homes and brave cheerfulness in meeting the trials,
hardships, and set-backs, which are incident to new settlements.</p>

<p>No question is so frequently asked by our correspondents as,
"How near can I get land to a Catholic Church?" In no portion
of any of the Catholic Colonies of Minnesota, established by
the Catholic Bureau, under the auspices of the Right Rev. Bishop
Ireland, shall a settler find himself beyond the easy reach of
church and priest.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40%;">
"It's na' to hide it in a hedge;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It's na' for train attendant;</span><br />
But for the glorious privilege<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of being independent."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Thus sung Robert Burns long ago in praise of independence.
This is one of the rewards which the land holds out to the
honest, hard-working, persevering settler; and never does it break
its promise to industry and perseverance.</p>

<p>In the city, dangers surround the poor laboring man; temptations
arise on every side to drag him down; insurmountable barriers
oppose his advancement.</p>

<p>Well, he may avoid the dangers&mdash;we wish to give the best view
of the case, and, thank God, there are thousands of instances to
sustain it&mdash;spurn the temptations, and even surmount some of the
outward barriers to his advancement. He may be respectably
housed and clothed; he may have a good boss. Ah, there is the
rub, good or bad&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">HE HAS A BOSS,</p>

<p>a man at whose nod he must come and go. He may have money
in a savings bank honestly managed; but if a spell of sickness
prostrates him, how much of his hard-earned savings will be left
when he rises from his sick bed? And suppose he feels that he
has his death sickness, can you, by going into sorrow's counting-house,
attempt to estimate the agony of the poor Catholic parent
when he thinks of the fate which may await his children, left fatherless
in a sinful city?</p>

<p>There are other pictures of a poor man's city life, which we care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
not to draw. But we will take this prosperous workingman, with
a good boss, from the city, and place him in his first rude house
on his own land. He misses many things, many comforts. He
misses the society of friends who used to come round from time to
time&mdash;the milkman's bell, the butcher's cart: everything was so
handy in the city.</p>

<p>He is lonely: a feeling of desolation comes over him as he stands
at the door of his new home, and looks around at the unimproved
land. The land is rich and good, and the scene is fair to look at;
but the reality is so different from the mental picture he made
before setting out for the West, that he feels sad and disappointed.
Then as he looks around him <i>at his own</i>,</p>


<p class="center">HE MISSES THE BOSS.</p>

<p>At the thought, the spirit of independence which has led this
man thousands of miles, perhaps, to seek a new home, and which
sadness and disappointment&mdash;the first effects of a great change&mdash;for
awhile subdued, leaps in his heart, and sends the red blood
surging through his veins.</p>


<p class="center">NO BOSS.</p>

<p>His eyes grow bright with pride as he looks out upon the land,
a wide circle of which he calls his own.</p>


<p class="center">THE BOSS HAS DISAPPEARED,</p>

<p>And the man, the owner of a wide stretch of real estate, conscious
of a great awaking of self-respect in his being, stands erect at the
door of his own house, on his own property, and feels that no one
better than he is, shall pass him by all day.</p>

<p>How the consciousness of independence, the feeling of self-respect,
will sustain this man through many hardships, disappointments
and trials!</p>

<p>In a short time one or two cows take the place of the dingy
cans of the milkman, and some young grunters in the hog pen
represent the meat-market.</p>

<p>After some years are past we visit the scene again. There is no
loneliness here now, for it is harvest time, and the farmer and his
sons are busy in the fields, his wife and eldest daughters busy in
the house preparing for the keen appetites the men will bring in
with them. The first rude shanty has given place to a nice two-story
frame house, well sheltered from sun and wind by the healthy
young trees the farmer planted with his own hands, and in the
rear are the snug barn and granary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Where once the wild prairie grass waved, comes the cheery clatter
of the harvester, and swath after swath of the golden grain falls
down before it.</p>

<p>By and by the younger children return from school, rosy and
hungry, and a small skirmisher is thrown out and enters the pantry;
he is repulsed and falls back on the main body; then, taking
advantage of the "good woman," being obliged to run to the
oven to keep the bread from burning, the whole force advance, a
pie is spiked and carried off in triumph.</p>

<p>As the shades of evening fall, a herd of cattle march lazily into
the farm yard, and then from the field come the farmer and his
sons. Lonely, indeed! Why the noise of Babel is renewed here.
Dipping his hot face in a basin of cool water, the farmer splutters
out his directions; seizing a jack towel, he scrubs his face, and
continues to halloo to Mike, and Tom, and Patrick. Why, <i>the
boss has come back</i>. Ay, but</p>


<p class="center">THE MAN HIMSELF IS THE BOSS NOW.</p>

<p>All things come to an end, so does the farmer's supper; and
as we sit with him on the porch outside we say,</p>

<p>"You have a splendid place here."</p>

<p>"It will do," he answers quite carelessly; but he can't fool us.
We know that he is proud of his success.</p>

<p>"I had to work hard for it," he continues, "but God has been
very good to us."</p>

<p>We are not romancing. We have drawn a picture from the
original, which can be duplicated a thousand fold in this State.</p>

<p>It is not individual success alone we can point to, but likewise
the success of whole farming communities, where the people commenced
poor&mdash;many of them, perhaps the majority, with scarcely
any means at all&mdash;under disadvantages that would now appear to
us, with railroads and markets on every side, almost insurmountable,
and where to-day we cannot find one exceptional case of
failure without an exceptional cause for it.</p>

<p>Thoroughly acquainted with the Catholic settlements in Minnesota,
we cannot call to mind a case where a hard-working, industrious,
sober man failed to make a comfortable home for his family.
We know of many cases where such a man met with reverses, lost
his crop, his cattle, his horses; but never a case where a man met
his reverses with a brave heart and trust in God, that he did not
overcome them, and come out of the battle a better and prouder
man.</p>

<p>Let a poor man in the city find his all swept away from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and what does he do? He slinks into its alleys and lanes, his
pleasant, decent rooms are changed for one foul room in a tenement
house, from whence, after a little, charity carries him to a
pauper's grave.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the general prosperity of our Catholic settlements
in Minnesota, and we have not to travel far from its capital
to find some of them&mdash;only into the adjoining county, Dakota, one
of the very finest in the State.</p>

<p>Fully two-thirds of the lands of the county are owned (mind,
<i>owned</i>.) by Catholic settlers, Irish and German.</p>

<p>Some twenty-five years ago, a few poor Irishmen settled in the
timber in this county. It was very generally supposed, at that
time, that people could not live on a prairie in Minnesota; but by
and by, those who had settled in Dakota county found out their
mistake, and commenced making claims on the adjoining prairie,
Rosemount prairie, to-day the garden of Minnesota.</p>

<p>But not before Hugh Derham, of the County Meath, Ireland,
now the Honorable Hugh Derham, came along and put up his
shanty on the prairie. "I had seven hundred dollars," he said to
us some time ago, "when I came on here; oxen were dear then, and
when I had a yoke bought, together with a cow, and my shanty
up, I had little or none of the money left. But I went to work,
broke up all the land I could, got seed, put in my first crop, and
lost every kernel of it."</p>

<p>To-day this man owns four hundred acres of improved land, in
a circle round his house. Fifty dollars an acre would be a low
value to put on his land. Some four years ago his neighbor, a
man of the name of Ennis, bought one hundred and twenty acres
of land adjoining, for something like ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>When Hugh Derham settled here there was not a railroad nearer
than two hundred miles of him, now passengers on the Milwaukee
and St. Paul Railroad, passing within half a mile in front of his
house, point from the windows of the cars to his place, as a model
home of a thrifty farmer.</p>

<p>His handsome, two-story frame house stands embowered in the
orchard and shade trees, sturdy Hugh Derham planted with his
own hands; his barn alone cost three thousand dollars; he has
flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and horses as he requires them;
and he has a good wife, who assisted him in his early struggles,
healthy, fresh and handsome still. He has had his eldest daughter
at a convent school, and bought for her last year a five hundred
dollar piano. It is said that he has some ten thousand dollars
loaned out at interest.</p>

<p>Now, is Hugh Derham's an exceptional case?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>If you came along, and we were inclined to brag, and show you
a specimen of our Catholic farmers in Minnesota, we would bring
you direct to Hugh Derham, not for his herds, and stock, and well
filled granary&mdash;he is surpassed by many of our farmers in all these&mdash;but
for the look of respectable thriftiness all around him. There
is his next neighbor, Wm. Murphy, another well-to-do, respectable
farmer, not perhaps as well off as Derham, but still able to
bear some time ago a loss of five thousand dollars by fire, and to
make no poor mouth about it. Another neighbor, Mich. Johnson,
a prosperous man, better still, a high spirited, fine fellow, and an
earnest worker in the cause of temperance. Another neighbor,
Tom Hiland, as rich a man as Derham. In the next township, the
Bennetts&mdash;three or four brothers that a poor but good, intelligent,
widowed mother, with much struggling, managed to bring West,
and locate on government land. These brothers now farm five
times as much land as Derham, and raise five times as much wheat.</p>

<p>And as we have been led into giving individual cases of success,&mdash;not
at first intended, for such cases must be always in certain
features more or less exceptional&mdash;we will give one more, that of
Mich. Whalen of Whalen township, Fillmore county.</p>

<p>His history is a remarkable one, as told by himself to us;
remarkable in his brave struggle for independence, his sagacity,
and final success. We give some points:</p>

<p>About thirty years ago Mich. Whalen landed from Ireland in
New York. He was then forty years of age, and had a wife and
eight children&mdash;all his wealth.</p>

<p>Yes, his wealth, he thought, if he could but reach with them the
broad acres of the West.</p>

<p>So he sawed wood for seventy-five cents a cord in the city of
New York: the more he sawed the less he liked the work, and
making a brave effort he found himself, with wife and children,
squatted on one hundred and sixty acres of government land in
Fillmore county, Minnesota.</p>

<p>When the land came into market he was not able to pay the
government price, one dollar and twenty-five cents an acre, but
Capt. McKenney, the then receiver of the U. S. Land Office, managed
to give him time, and the next year's crop enabled him to
pay up. At this time John, his eldest of six sons, was sixteen
years of age, and able to help his father.</p>

<p>To-day Mich. Whalen is the owner of thirteen hundred acres
of land in Fillmore county. The village of Whalen with mills
and a fine water power, is on his land: or rather, on the land of
his son John, for as the boys get married the old man gives them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
title to portions of the land, on which they build. There is
another mill within a few rods of the old homestead, and there is
not less than from six thousand to ten thousand bushels of wheat
raised on the farm each year.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Whalen," said a friend some time ago, "you got
on splendidly; with such a large and almost helpless family at the
beginning, I don't see how you could have managed it."</p>

<p>"We put our trust in God, <i>avourneen</i>!" replied the old man,
"and we stuck together."</p>

<p>Where were the special advantages in this man's case; which enabled
the poor wood-sawyer of New York to become one of the
solid men of a rich county?</p>

<p>They are to be found in the fact that he was blessed with good
children, who, as they grew up and became able to help him, remained
at home and did help&mdash;and amply are they rewarded for it
to day&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"THEY STUCK TOGETHER."</p>

<p>But it is of the general prosperity of our Catholic settlements in
Minnesota that we wish more particularly to speak, for as a general
rule there is no business which has not its representative successful
men.</p>

<p>Dakota County being close to the capital of the State, (St. Paul,)
and possessing the advantage of having, on the Mississippi River,
a market for its produce, at a time when there was not a mile of
railroad in the State, was settled up at an early day. Among its
settlers were Irish and German Catholics. From that period out
these settlers have not alone held their own, but, year after year
receiving fresh additions to their numbers, they have advanced
from township to township, buying improved farms and wild land,
until, as we have stated before, two-thirds of the lands of the
county belong to them.</p>

<p>Travel which side you will, and you shall find evidence that one
"can read as he runs" of their prosperity, intelligence and respectability;
handsome houses, good offices, young orchards, ornamental
planting, and the grand big wheat fields around, which have supplied
the means to build up those pleasant homes.</p>

<p>Traveling along down the Mississippi to the eastern boundary of
the State and taking a wide range of country on the Minnesota
side of the river, we find many prosperous settlements of our
people. Again southwest, up the beautiful valley of the Minnesota
River, in Scott, Sibley, Le Sueur, Nicollet and Blue Earth
counties, there are numerous Catholic settlements, both in the
woods and on the prairie. So, too, in the midland counties of Rice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Steele, Waseca, Olmsted, Dodge and Mower counties, our people are
settled, prosperous and happy, their valuable farms giving ample
and cheerful evidence, how bountifully the soil rewards honest
labor. Nor, in their prosperity, have they forgotten Him from
whom all blessings flow.</p>

<p>Where a few years ago the Catholic settlers, few and poor,
waited anxiously for the visit of the priest, and where the holy
sacrifice of the mass was offered up in the settler's cabin, we now
find the resident priest, the handsome church, and in many
instances, the Sisters' school. In those settlements the whole
atmosphere is Catholic; here, with no bad influences around them,
the young people grow up pure and virtuous, with the love of their
religion warm in their hearts. An ample reward to their parents,
those brave men, the early settlers, who displayed such indomitable
perseverance in their battle for</p>


<p class="center">INDEPENDENCE.</p>

<p>They had to steer their way with the compass, over trackless
prairies, often while the snow lay upon the ground, to blaze their
way through the forest or follow an Indian trail, carrying their
provisions on their backs, and when the claim shanty was put up
and the provisions exhausted, the new settler would often have to
return twenty, forty, sixty miles to some place where he could buy
a few more pounds of flour, and with this and perhaps half a
bushel of potatoes to put in the ground, he would again set off to
his new claim.</p>

<p>But in all the privations they went through, those connected
with religion they felt the most. And, praise be to God, among
the earliest evidences of their growing prosperity was the erection
of temples to His worship, that to-day, on every side, ornament
the State. Wherever in the State there is a clustering of Catholic

<h2><a name="RELIGIOUS_AND_MORAL_VIEW_OF_THE_QUESTION" id="RELIGIOUS_AND_MORAL_VIEW_OF_THE_QUESTION">RELIGIOUS AND MORAL VIEW OF THE QUESTION
OF IMMIGRATION TO THE LAND.</a></h2>


<p>To a Catholic, this is, after all, the most important view, and
must not be overlooked; at the same time it is obvious that it
cannot be done justice to in a condensed pamphlet of this kind.</p>

<p>There is about the same difference between the moral atmosphere
of the rural Catholic colonies to which we invite our people,
and the back streets and alleys of the over-crowded city, as there is
between the pure air of the prairie and the foul air of the city lane.</p>

<p>Some time ago, a friend from the East, to whom we were showing
some of our Catholic settlements, said to us,</p>

<p>"Why, it is not surprising that the people settled out here in
the country should be moral and religious, they have much to
make them so, and nothing to make them otherwise in their surroundings;
but look at our poor people, huddled together in the
tenement houses of New York. When you find them good, give
them praise."</p>

<p>"And many of them are good," we said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he answered; "but the great danger is to the children.
The priest does his best, the Catholic parent grounded in
his religion before he ever saw a city does his best, but his circumstances
compel him to live where the foul air reeks with blasphemy,
and low debauchery; vice and drunkenness are ever before their
eyes."</p>

<p>This is a very sad picture, but a very true one. It is a fearful
reality before the eyes of many a poor Catholic parent, who obliged
to be continually absent from his children, knows but too well the
society they are likely to fall into.</p>

<p>In our Catholic colonies in Minnesota a parent has no such
dread. He knows where his boys are on week days; they are helping
him on the farm. He knows where they are on Sundays; they
are with him at church. When they are amusing themselves, he
knows that they are with the young people of his neighbors, their
companions and co-religionists.</p>

<p>Here, too, the anxious heart of the loving mother is at rest; for
she sees her daughters associating with the good and innocent of
their own age, and growing up pure and virtuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"God made the country and man made the town," is an old
saying. The immigration of those of our people adapted to agricultural
life from the city to the land will be a benefit, not alone
to themselves, but to those they leave behind. By this healthful
drain the latter will be left more room, and have more opportunities
to better their condition.</p>

<p>From any side we view it, it is a great and good work to encourage
and labor for Catholic immigration to the land, where <span class="smcap">independence</span>
shall reward labor, and Catholic zeal shall spread our
holy faith over the fertile prairies of the West.</p>

<p>We would be very sorry to see, even if it was practicable, our
people leaving the cities <i>en masse</i>. Many of them, well adapted
for city life, rise to prosperity and social position in the city.
Some to high professional or business standing, others to moderate
respectable independence; others, in humbler walks of life, to
decent homes of their own, and the city affords to the well brought
up children of such homes, many solid advantages. We want full
representation for our people in the city, and full representation
on the land. By encouraging those of our people adapted, and
best adapted for agricultural pursuits, to seek the land, we benefit
them and benefit those who remain behind as well, for we give
the latter healthy room and more opportunities: in a word, we
improve the condition of our people, both in the city and in the
country.</p>

WHAT THEY MAY EXPECT.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>THE CLASS WE INVITE.&mdash;THE PROPER TIMBER MUST BE IN THE

<p>The great drawback to organized colonization is, that people
expect too much; therefore we will be explicit, and state exactly
what is proposed to be done for those coming to the Catholic colonies
of Minnesota. In the first place, they will get in this pamphlet
truthful and full statistics of the State, so far as those statistics
are of interest to them; they will also get full details in regard to
our colonies, and all the directions and information necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>When they arrive here (in St. Paul,) by calling at the office of
the Catholic Colonization Bureau they will be directed to whichever
colony they may wish to go. Arrived at the colony, they
will be shown over its lands. Then when the immigrant has
made his selection and taken possession, he must depend from
thenceforth, on himself, and the more he does so the more he will
feel himself a man.</p>

<p>The Catholic immigrant coming now to Minnesota will not be
subject to the severe trials and hardships the early settlers encountered,
while he will be altogether exempt from the religious and
social privations they had to bear through many lonely years.</p>

<p>The immigrant is now conveyed to the Catholic Colony he may
select, by railroad train, and finds before him church and priest,
market and settlers; nevertheless he should be a man possessing
that noble quality which western life so well develops&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">SELF-RELIANCE.</p>

<p>Under God, it is on himself he must depend for future success.</p>

<p>And here is the proper place to speak of the class of persons
whom we can confidently invite to our Catholic colonies&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">FARMERS ALONE.</p>

<p>Not necessarily those who have heretofore been engaged altogether
in agricultural pursuits, but persons who come to settle on
farms, and who are able and willing to hold the plow. The poor
man to succeed on a farm in Minnesota, must hold his own plow,
and do his own chores; and, above all, have courage and strength
to depend upon himself.</p>

<p>If he has a good, healthy, cheerful, wife, who prefers the prattle
of her children to the gossip of the street, why, all the better&mdash;let
him come along, and we will put him on the road to</p>


<p class="center">PROSPERITY.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>ITS GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION&mdash;SIZE&mdash;OPINIONS OF DISTINGUISHED
MEN&mdash;FERTILITY, BEAUTY AND HEALTHFULNESS OF THE STATE.</p></blockquote>


<p>The State contains 83,153 square miles or 53,459,840 acres, and
is, therefore, one of the largest in the Union. It occupies the exact
centre of the continent of North America. It lies midway between
the Arctic and Tropic circles&mdash;midway between the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans&mdash;and midway between Hudson's Bay and the Gulf
of Mexico. It embraces the sources of three vast water systems
which reach their ocean termini, northward through Hudson's
Bay, eastward through the chain of great lakes, and southward
via the Mississippi River. It extends from 43-1/2° to 49° of north
latitude, and from 89° 29' to 97° 5' of west longitude; and is bounded
on the north by the Winnipeg district of British America, on the
west by the Territory of Dakota, on the south by the State of
Iowa, and on the east by Lake Superior and the State of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In official reports before us, we find many interesting extracts
from the writings of well-known public men, agriculturists, geologists,
professors in various branches of science, engineers, surveyors
and government officials, who have visited Minnesota at
various times on business or pleasure, and who have borne enthusiastic
testimony of her resources, the fertility of her soil, the
healthfulness of her climate and the beauty of her scenery.</p>

<p>A few sentences from all these writings will suffice for us in
this place.</p>

<p>In the official report of General Pope, who was commissioned
by the government to make a topographical survey of portions of
the State, we find the following sentence, which embraces almost
all that can be said in praise. He says:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I know</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">no country</span> <i>on</i> <span class="smcap">earth</span> <i>where so</i> <span class="smcap">many</span> <i>advantages
are presented to the</i> <span class="smcap">farmer and manufacturer</span>."</p>

<p>The adaptability of our rich soil for all the staple crops, as
proven by experience, the large yield per acre in wheat, oats,
potatoes, &amp;c., &amp;c., the immense quantity of good land in large
bodies, the truly magnificent water power within the State, and
so beneficently located in its different sections; all these advantages,
seen beneath a sky always bright, and in a climate at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
seasons healthy, may well account for the enthusiasm which
inspired the above eulogy on Minnesota.</p>

<p>The accredited correspondent of the Chicago Tribune, who visited
this State some three years ago, is equally enthusiastic in his
published letters to his paper. We give two extracts from those
letters.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No wonder the people here wear such smiling countenances. They are
full of hope. I have yet to see the first despairing or gloomy face. Melancholy
belongs to the overcrowded cities, and there is plenty of it in
Chicago.</p>

<p>"Is it not astonishing that so many able-bodied men should hang about
our large cities doing nothing, because they can find nothing to do, and
nearly starving to death, when these broad and fertile prairies are calling
upon them to come and release the treasures which lie within the soil.</p>

<p>"The resources or this State are immense. It has every variety of wealth,
and every facility for profitable exchange. There is no more productive
soil in the world. Then the State has an abundance of pine timber. It has a
vast amount of available water power, and offers every facility and encouragement
to manufacturing industry. It has mineral wealth on Lake Superior
of iron and copper, in inexhaustible abundance. There is no region in this
country, or any country, that I am aware of, that is so well watered. And
the water is everywhere clear and pure. It is a land of great rivers, pellucid
lakes, and sparkling streams.</p>

<p>"All this may sound enthusiastic, but every word is calmly written and
justified by the facts; and it is strictly within the facts. If the advantages
of this region were only adequately made known, there would surely be a
great flow of labor from the cities and places where it is not wanted, into a
region like this, where every variety of labor is needed and where it is certain
to meet with a rich reward."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the second extract we give, this correspondent expresses himself
in language very similar to that made use of by General Pope.
He says, still speaking of Minnesota:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I know of no other portion of the earth's surface where so many advantages
are concentrated, and where the man of industry and small means
may so quickly and with so much certainty render himself independent.
Here you have a climate of exceeding purity, a soil of amazing productiveness,
abundance of the clearest water, with groves, and lakes, and rivers and
streams wherever they are wanted. Then the great railway lines are beginning
to intersect this country in all directions, and thus furnish the farmer
with a cheap and immediate outlet for his produce."</p></blockquote>

<p>We will close these brief extracts&mdash;taken from the writings of
persons well qualified to form a sound judgment on the subject
they were discussing, and totally unconnected personally with the
interests of Minnesota&mdash;with two extracts from a speech of the
distinguished statesman, Hon. Wm. H. Seward, delivered in St.
Paul, the capital of our State, so far back as 1860.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Seward said, and America has not produced so far-seeing a
statesman:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here is the place&mdash;the central place&mdash;where the agriculture of the richest
region of North America must pour out its tributes to the whole world.
On the east, all along the shore of Lake Superior, and west, stretching in
one broad plain in a belt quite across the continent, is a country where State
after State is yet to rise, and where the productions for the support of human
society in the old crowded States must be brought forth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I now believe that the ultimate last seat of government on this great continent
will be found, somewhere within a circle or radius not very far from
the spot on which I stand, at the head of navigation on the Mississippi
river."</p></blockquote>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="GENERAL_STATE_STATISTICS" id="GENERAL_STATE_STATISTICS">GENERAL STATE STATISTICS.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>LAKES, RIVERS, TIMBER, CLIMATE, SOIL, STOCK RAISING.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the following we have borrowed much from authorized State
reports, adding our own comments when necessary.</p>


<p class="center">LAKES.</p>

<p>Minnesota abounds in lakes of great beauty. They are from
one to fifty miles in diameter, and are well stocked with a variety
of fish. Those beautiful lakes are found in every portion of the
State, sparkling on the open prairie, hidden in groves, or resting
calm and pure in the depths of the silent forest.</p>

<p>"It may be interesting," says John W. Bond, Secretary of the
Minnesota State Board of Immigration, "to note the areas of a
few of the largest lakes in our State. Lake Minnetonka contains
16,000 acres; Lake Winnebagoshish, 56,000 acres; Leech Lake,
114,000 acres; and Mille Lacs, 130,000 acres. Red Lake, which
is much larger than any other in the State, has not yet been surveyed.</p>

<p>"The above estimate of 2,700,000 acres in lakes does not embrace
the vast water areas included in the projected boundary lines
of the State in Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods, and along
the great water stretches of the international line."</p>

<p>The importance to the State of having Lake Superior as an
outlet for its produce cannot be overestimated. The day is not
distant when a large amount of grain will be shipped in bulk from
the Minnesota harbor (Duluth) on Lake Superior, to the Liverpool
market in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">RIVERS.</p>

<p>Minnesota has five navigable rivers. The Mississippi (The
Father of Waters,) having its rise in Lake Itaska, in the northern
part of the State.</p>

<p>The St. Croix, flowing through a large portion of the lumbering
region.</p>

<p>The Minnesota, rising in Dakota Territory and flowing through
a large portion of the State empties into the Mississippi, five
miles above St. Paul. It is navigable, in favorable seasons, about
300 miles.</p>

<p>The Red River of the North, forming the northwestern boundary
of the State for a distance of 380 miles, and navigable about 250.</p>

<p>The St. Louis River, flowing into Lake Superior on our northeastern
boundary, a distance of 135 miles.</p>

<p>Besides these, the largest rivers are the Root, Rum, Crow, Sauk,
Elk, Long Prairie, Crow Wing, Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Maple,
Cobb, Watonwan, Snake, Kettle, Redwood, Wild Rice, Buffalo,
Chippewa, Marsh, Pomme de Terre, Lac qui Parle, Mustinka, Yellow
Medicine, Two Rivers, Cottonwood, Cannon, Zumbro, Whitewater,
Cedar, Red Lake, Straight, Vermillion, and others. These,
with a vast number of smaller streams tributary to them, ramifying
through fertile upland and grassy meadow, in every section of
the State, afford invaluable facilities for the various purposes of
lumbering, milling, manufacturing and agriculture.</p>

<p>In connection with her rivers, we will say that Minnesota has
perhaps the finest water power, within her bounds, to be found in
the world. This power is found all over the State, and though
only very partially developed, it serves to manufacture 2,600,000
barrels of flour annually, and runs 250 saw mills.</p>


<p class="center">TIMBER.</p>

<p>Minnesota is neither a timber nor a prairie State; yet it possesses
in a large degree the advantages of both, there being unquestionably
a better proportion of timber and prairie, and a more
admirable intermingling of the two than in any other State. It
is estimated that about one-third of Minnesota is timbered land,
of more or less dense growth. In Iowa, it has been officially estimated
that only about one-tenth to one-eight of the State is
timbered.</p>

<p>On the head-waters of the various tributaries of the extreme
Upper Mississippi and St. Croix rivers is an extensive forest
country, known as the "pine region," comprising an estimated
area of 21,000 square miles. Extending in a northeasterly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
southwesterly direction, about 100 miles long, and an average
width of 40, is the largest body of hard-wood timber between the
Mississippi and Missouri rivers. It lies on both sides of the Minnesota
River, comprising in all an area of 5,000 square miles, and
is known as the "Big Woods."</p>


<p class="center">CLIMATE.</p>

<p>Prominent among the questions proposed by the immigrant
seeking a new home in a new country, are those concerning the
climate, its temperature, adaptation to the culture of the grand
staples of food, and its healthfulness.</p>

<p>"The climate of Minnesota has often been the subject of unjust
disparagement. 'It is too far north;' 'the winters are intolerable.'
These and other similar remarks have found expression by those
who should have known better. To the old settler of Minnesota,
the seasons follow each other in pleasing succession. As the sun
approaches his northern latitude, winter relaxes its grasp, streams
and lakes are unbound, flowers spring up as if by the touch of
some magic wand, and gradually spring is merged into the bright,
beautiful June, with its long, warm days, and short, but cool and
refreshing nights. The harvest months follow in rapid succession,
till the golden Indian summer of early November foretells the
approach of cold and snow; and again winter, with its short days
of clear, bright sky and bracing air, and its long nights of cloudless
beauty, completes the circle."</p>

<p>"Men," says the late J. B. Phillips, Commissioner of Statistics,
"suffer themselves to be deluded with the idea that heat is in some
way a positive good, and cold a positive evil. The world is in
need of a sermon on the gospel and blessing of cold.</p>

<p>"What is there at best in the indolent languor of tropic siestas
for any live man or woman to be pining after? Macauley, after
his residence in India, did not. He said that you boiled there four
or five months in the year, then roasted four or five more, and had
the remainder of the year to 'get cool if you could.' 'If you
could!' No way of refrigerating a tropic atmosphere has ever
yet been devised; while you can be perfectly comfortable in any
north temperate zone."</p>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<p>"The healthfulness of Minnesota is one of its strongest points.
Having been, for a long time, a sanitary resort for persons threatened
with pulmonary complaints, it has disappointed no reasonable
expectation. It is equally favorable for those afflicted with
liver diseases. Thus for the two great organs in the tripod of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the liver and lungs, that is for two-thirds of life, Minnesota offers
the most favorable conditions. She is more exempt from paludial
fevers then any new State settled in the last half century. The
fearful cost of human life it has required to subdue the soil in the
States along the line of lat. 40° has never been estimated. With
a moist, decaying vegetation, and a certain intensity and duration
of summer and autumn heat, sickness of that kind is certain to
come, no matter what they may <i>say</i> about having 'no sickness
here.' It always exists when the requisite conditions are present.
Freed from the depressing influence of this decimating foe, the
average Minnesotian eats with a craving appetite, sleeps well,
moves with a quick step and elastic spirits, and fights his life-battle
sturdily and hopefully to the issue."</p>

<p>The mean yearly temperature of our Minnesota climate, (44.6,)
coincides with that of Central Wisconsin, Michigan, Central New
York, Southern Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine; but in
the dryness of its atmosphere it has, both for health and comfort,
at great advantage over those States. It is well known that dampness
is the element from whence come sickness and suffering,
either in cold or warm weather, and the dry atmosphere of winter
in Minnesota, at an average temperature of 16°, makes the cold less
felt than in warmer but damper climates several degrees farther
south.</p>

<p>With the new year generally commences the severe cold of our
winter, but for the last few seasons the old Minnesota winters
seem to be giving place to much milder ones. During last winter
the thermometer, in the most exposed places, scarcely ever marked
zero, and now, on the 21st of December&mdash;weeks after they have
had fierce snow storms south and southwest of us&mdash;good sleighing
in Chicago and St. Louis&mdash;we are getting our first regular fall of
snow, (only a slight sprinkling before,) which is falling unaccompanied
with either wind or cold and giving a good promise of
merry sleigh rides during the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>Whether or not there has come a permanent change in our
Minnesota winters, brought about by causes affected by population
and settlement, we cannot say; but that such a change would not
be acceptable to many of our old settlers we are convinced; not
certainly to the enthusiast who writes as follows of our old, crisp,
bright winters:</p>

<p>"Winter in Minnesota is a season of ceaseless business activity,
and constant social enjoyment; and by those accustomed to long
wintry storms, and continued alternations of mud, and cold, and
snow, is pronounced far preferable to the winters in any section of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the Northern States. Here there is an exhilaration in the crisp
atmosphere which quickens the blood, and sends the bounding
steps over the ringing snow with an exultant flurry of good-spirits
akin to the highest enjoyment."</p>

<p>Doubtless this was written from the stand-point of warm robes,
a light cutter, a fast horse, and tingling sleigh-bells; nevertheless
it is in the main true. When the surface of the body is warmly
clothed, one can enjoy out-door exercise in the winter with every
comfort.</p>

<p>The greatest and only objection that we find against the winter
season in Minnesota, is its length.&mdash;It is true that, as a general
rule, we have all our spring wheat in the ground, and for the most
part over ground, before the end of April.&mdash;This infringement of
winter, as we may term it, upon the domain of spring, is the
draw-back to our climate.</p>

<p>It is a slight one compared to those of other climates, where
spring brings with its flowers, fever, ague, and chills.</p>

<p>The summer months are pleasant. We have hot days, as one
can judge by bearing in mind that our wheat crop is put into the
ground, cut and often threshed, all within three months, but our
nights are always beautiful and cool. Then comes autumn, when
the wayside copse, blushing at the hot kisses of the sun, turns
scarlet, and every tint of shade and color is seen in the variegated
foliage of the forest; and then the hazy, Indian summer&mdash;nothing
so lovely could last long on earth&mdash;when forest and prairie, dell and
highland, palpitate with a hushed beauty, and to live is happiness
sufficient.</p>

<p>Pure air is health, life. Winter and summer, fall and spring, the
air of Minnesota, free from all malaria, is pure. We promise to
the new settler making a home on land in Minnesota, plenty of
hard work, and the best of health and spirits&mdash;so far as climate
has any effect on those blessings, and it has a great deal&mdash;while
doing it. It will not be necessary for him to get acclimated, but
to pitch right in.</p>

<p>Disturnell, author of a work on the "Influence of Climate in
North and South America," says that "<i>Minnesota may be said to
excel any portion of the Union in a healthy and invigorating climate</i>."</p>

<p>The above is so conclusive an exhibit in confirmation of the
healthfulness of the Minnesota climate, that it exhausts the subject.</p>


<p class="center">SOIL.</p>

<p>Under this head, the late J. B. Phillips, Commissioner of Statistics,
from whose work we have already quoted, says:</p>

<p>"The soil of the arable part of the State is generally of the best
quality, rich in lime and organic matter, and particularly well
adapted to the growth of wheat, over 26,400,000 bushels of which
cereal were produced in 1873, and over 30,000,000 in 1875.
Although its fertility has never been disputed, these authentic
figures prove it beyond question. Good wheat lands in a favorable
season will produce from 25 to 30 bushels to the acre. I believe
the whole county of Goodhue, in a yield of between 3,000,000 and
4,000,000 bushels, very nearly averaged the first figures in 1875.
A great portion of the State is equally adapted to stock raising,
and many farmers think it would be more profitable."</p>

<p>We will add to this, by way of a note, that in 1877, as
will be seen on another page, Minnesota with only 3,000,000
acres of her land under cultivation, produced 35,000,000 bushels
of wheat, almost all No. 1 quality, and that Goodhue County,
mentioned in the extract quoted, had a yield of 4,050,250 bushels.</p>


<p class="center">STOCK RAISING.</p>

<p>We know of no country where stock, horses and sheep, do better
than in Minnesota, and we believe that it will be found true that
the climate conducive to the health of human beings is one where
all kinds of domestic animals will thrive.</p>

<p>We had, some time ago, a very interesting conversation with
Mr. Featherston, an English gentleman residing in Goodhue
County, on this subject.</p>

<p>He informed us that he had farmed in England, in the State of
New York, in Kansas, and now in Minnesota, and he was never
in a place where sheep and stock did better than here. "I
attribute this," he said, "to the dryness of our winter weather.
Sheep here are not weighed down with wet fleeces; and as for cattle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
they suffer more in southern Kansas, where they can remain out all
the year, than they do here in the coldest days of winter."</p>

<p>"How is that?" we asked.</p>

<p>"Easily accounted for," he replied. "One part of the day, in
Kansas, it will be raining, the coats of the cattle will be saturated
with wet, then it comes on to freeze, and they become sheeted
with ice; this is very injurious to the health of a beast. Sheep
raising in Minnesota I have found very profitable farming indeed."</p>

<p>"What about the soil of Minnesota?" we asked.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "I was home in England two years ago,
traveled about a good deal, and did not see any soil equal to the
soil of Minnesota."</p>

<p>Now, in speaking of Minnesota for stock-raising, it must be
borne in mind that it is more expensive to keep cattle here, where
they must be fed many months in the year, than where they can
run at large the whole year; but, if properly housed during winter,
young cattle fed on wild hay&mdash;which can be put up for $1.50 per
ton&mdash;will come out in the spring in fine condition.</p>

<p>The opportunities of getting wild hay in the localities where our
Catholic colonies are located, are not surpassed in any part of the
State; and it will be borne in mind that if there is extra expense
and trouble in raising cattle here, there is also extra good prices
to get for them. A steer that will sell for $10 in places where,
like Topsey, he "just grows," will sell here for from $30 to $40.</p>

<p>The following, taken from a late report of a committee of the
Chamber of Commerce, St. Paul, will be read with interest:</p>

<p>"Our climate and soil appear to be peculiarly adapted for grazing
purposes. Its healthfulness for cattle of every kind is well
established. The abundant and prolific yield of both tame and
wild or natural grasses, of every description incident to the West,
affords abundant and cheap pasturage during the summer, and the
choicest of hay for winter, which is produced at less expense per
ton than in most of the States in the Union. If necessary, your
committee could refer to countless instances in regard to the profit
of raising stock in the State. The demand for horses has always
been in excess of the supply. Thousands are introduced into
our midst every year from the adjoining States. The demand will
increase as the country west of us becomes settled. Choice herds
of cattle have been imported into the State during the past few
years, attended in every instance, as far as your committee have
been able to learn, with much profit to the enterprising parties
who embarked in the lucrative business. The dairy is being
introduced in the shape of cheese and butter factories in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
neighborhoods and attended with much success. It appears that
shipments of both these home products have been made to
England with satisfactory results. The sheep-fold to some extent
has been neglected, but those who have engaged in wool-growing
are greatly encouraged. Flocks of sheep brought from the East
have, with their progeny, improved to such an extent by the influence
of our climate, that they have been repurchased by those
from whom they were originally bought, and transported back
East to improve the breed of their stock. The wool becomes of a
finer texture when produced in our State, also an increase in size
of the carcass of the sheep."</p>

<p>The advantages which our present Catholic colonies afford,
abounding in nutritious grasses and the best quality of wild hay
lands, will we trust turn the attention of settlers to stock raising,
butter packing and cheese factories, and we are informed that
some enterprising parties are going to establish one of the latter
at Clontarf, in Swift County Colony. Farming to be prosperous
the industry on the farm must be diversified; there should be
rotation of crops. It will not do to depend altogether on wheat or
to be too ambitious to have a great breadth of it under cultivation;
not an acre more than the farmer knows he will be well able to
have out of the ground in good season, making no chance calculations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>WHEAT, OATS, POTATOES, CORN, HAY, SORGHUM, FRUITS.</p></blockquote>


<p>In 1849, Minnesota was organized into a territory, and the following
year, 1850, she had under cultivation 1,900 acres of land.
In 1877, she had 3,000,000 acres. In these twenty-seven years,
during which the breadth of her cultivated lands has increased
over one thousand five hundred fold, the quality and average
quantity per acre of all the great staple crops have been equally
satisfactory, until we find her to-day, taking the foremost place
as an agricultural State.</p>

<p>To quote from the writings of the Hon. Pennock Pusey, than
whom there is no more upright gentleman nor one more qualified
to deal with statistics, we find that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"According to the census of 1870, the entire wheat product of New England
was sufficient to feed her own people only three weeks! That of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
York sufficient for her own consumption six months; that of Pennsylvania,
after feeding her own people, afforded no surplus; while the surplus of Ohio
was but 3,000,000 bushels for that year, and for the past six years her wheat
crop has fallen below her own consumption. In the ten years ending in
1870, the wheat crop of these States decreased 6,500,000 bushels.</p>

<p>"In the light of these facts, the achievements of Minnesota in wheat
growing, as well as her untaxed capacity for the continued and increased
production of that grain, assume a proud pre-eminence."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not too high praise for Minnesota, when we find the
great State of Ohio for the last six years failing to raise sufficient
wheat for her own consumption, while Minnesota with but
2,232,988 acres under wheat, has, after bountifully supplying her
own population, exported in 1877 over fifteen million of bushels.</p>

<p>The important position which Minnesota is destined, in the
near future, to assume as a great contributor to the supply of the
most important article of food used by the human family, is well
put forward by Mr. Pusey in the paper we have already quoted
from. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But a more practical as well as serious aspect of the subject pertains to
those social problems connected with supplies of bread. The grave significance
of the question involved is not susceptible of concealment, when the
fact is considered, that while the consumption of wheat, as the choice food
of the human race, is rapidly extending, the capacity of wheat-growing
regions for its production is rapidly diminishing."</p></blockquote>

<p>We will now give some extracts from the report of the late J.
B. Philips, Commissioner of Statistics. We select from his
report with great satisfaction, because he has been very careful to
make his calculations rather under than over the truth.</p>

<p>We find the following under the head of</p>


<p class="center">WHEAT, 1875.</p>

<p>The number of bushels of wheat gathered and threshed, according
to the returns reported to the Commissioner for the year 1875,
was 28,769,736; but there were 77,032 acres unreported, which at
17-1/2 bushels per acre, (the general average,) would make a total of
30,079,300 bushels.</p>

<p>The number of acres reported as cultivated in wheat for 1875
was 1,764,109.</p>

<p>Illinois, with her large cultivated area, has until recently been
the largest wheat-raising State. In 1860 she produced 23,837,023
bushels, and in 1870 30,128,405 bushels.</p>

<p>"In 1871," says one of her statisticians, "the United States
produced 235,884,700 bushels of wheat, of which 27,115,000 are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
assigned to Illinois, or about 700,000 bushels more than any other
State."</p>

<p>In 1871 the product of the United States was 230,722,400
bushels, of which Illinois had 25,216,000, being followed by Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa.</p>

<p>In 1870 Illinois produced 30,128,405. "But," says the same
authority, "we now (1870) find Iowa close alongside of us, her
product being 29,435,692 bushels of wheat."</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that neither Minnesota nor California were
deemed worthy of notice in this rivalry of these older States.
But in three years from that date Minnesota, as well as Iowa, was
"close alongside" of Illinois, raising from 15 millions in 1870 to
22 millions in 1872, and 26,402,485 in 1873. In 1874 the wheat
product of Minnesota was within a fraction of 24 millions. I
give her yields in this table:</p>

<p>"It will be observed," remarks the Commissioner, "that according
to these figures Minnesota ranks fourth."</p>

<p>True enough, but fast on the heels of 1875 comes the crop of
1877, and with a bounce to 35,000,000 bushels of wheat Minnesota
stands at the head of all as a wheat-producing State.</p>

<p>Or 24-1/3 bushels to every acre under cultivation. But the average
is much higher than this, for in the above table no account is
taken of the gardens and large breadth of flax under cultivation.</p>

<p>The official report, when published, may differ slightly with the
above, but not to an extent to make any alteration necessary.</p>

<p>We are informed that, in several instances, land giving wheat
for the last twenty years, without being fertilized or manured,
produced in 1877 over twenty bushels of wheat to the acre; a fact
creditable to the land, but very discreditable to the farmers
engaged in such <i>land murder</i>.</p>

<p>While Minnesota has, without dispute, established her reputation
as a great wheat producer, and the dangers which always lie
in wait for the growing crops are perhaps less here than in most
of the other western States, still it must not be supposed that we
can expect to be always free from them. If we had any such idea
it would have been dispelled by our experience the past season.
Never since the State was organized was there a finer prospect of
a magnificent wheat yield than we had during the months of May,
June and the first half of July, 1878. It was not that the general crop
was good, but one could not, in a day's travel, find one poor looking
field; but just as the wheat was within a few days of being fit to
cut, a fierce, hot sun, lasting a week or so, came and wilted up the
grain, so that the crop lost materially in quality, weight and
measure.</p>

<p>Yet this evil had its compensating good. Our corn and potato
crops were very fine, so that our farmers have learned a lesson in
the value of having diversity of crops as a leading feature in their
farming system, and be it remembered that without system there
is no successful farming.</p>

<p>The following statement is taken from the immigration pamphlet,
issued by the Minnesota Board of Immigration for 1878:</p>


<p class="center">OATS.</p>

<p>Oats is peculiarly a northern grain. It is only with comparatively
cool atmosphere that this grain attains the solidity, and
yields the return which remunerate the labor and cost of production.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
The rare adaptation of the soil and climate of Minnesota to
the growth of this grain, is shown not only by the large average,
but the superior quality of the product, the oats of this State being
heavier by from three to eight pounds per bushel than that produced
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The following is an exhibit of the result for the several years
named:</p>

</table>


<p class="center">CORN.</p>

<p>The foregoing exhibits abundantly sustain the extraordinary
capacity of Minnesota for the production of those cereals which
are best produced in high latitudes. Our State is often supposed
to be too far north for Indian corn. This is a great mistake,
founded on the popular fallacy that the latitude governs climate.
But climates grow warmer towards the west coasts of continents;
and although its winters are cold, the summers of Minnesota are
as warm as those of Southern Ohio. <i>The mean summer heat of St.
Paul is precisely that of Philadelphia</i>, five degrees further south,
while it is considerably warmer during the whole six months of
the growing season than Chicago, three degrees further south.
The products of the soil confirm these meteorological indications.</p>

<p>The average yield of corn in 1868 was 37.33 bushels per acre,
and in 1875&mdash;a bad year&mdash;25 bushels. In Illinois&mdash;of which corn
is the chief staple&mdash;Mr. Lincoln, late President of the United
States, in the course of an agricultural address in 1859, stated that
the average crop from year to year does not exceed twenty bushels
per acre.</p>

<p>These results, so favorable to Minnesota as a corn growing as
well as wheat growing State, will surprise no one who is familiar
with the fact established by climatologists, that "the cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
plants yield the greatest products near the northernmost limits at
which they will grow."</p>

<p class="center">HAY.</p>

<p>Among the grasses that appear to be native to the soil of Minnesota
are found timothy, white clover, blue grass and red top.
They grow most luxuriantly, and many claim that they contain
nearly as much nutriment as ordinary oats. So excellent are the
grasses that the tame varieties are but little cultivated. The wild
grasses which cover the immense surface of natural meadow land
formed by the alluvial bottoms of the intricate network of streams
which everywhere intersect the country, are as rich and nutritious
in this latitude as the best exotic varieties, hence cultivation is
unnecessary. The yield of these grasses is 2.12 tons to the acre,
or 60 per cent more than that of Ohio, the great hay State!</p>


<p class="center">SORGHUM.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the sugar cane is fast becoming popular
among the farmers of Minnesota, and one Mr. Seth H. Kenney,
of Rice county, claims that it can be made more profitable than
even the wheat crop. The syrup and sugar produced is of the
finest character, possessing an extremely excellent flavor. An
acre of properly cultivated land will yield from one hundred and
seventy-five to two hundred gallons of syrup, worth seventy cents
a gallon.</p>


<p class="center">FRUITS.</p>

<p>The following short extracts are taken from a paper written by
Col. D. A. Robertson, of St. Paul, a scientific amateur fruit
grower; one thoroughly conversant with the subject on which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
writes, and to whose disinterested labors in this branch of industry
the State owes much:</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that Minnesota will become a great fruit
State, because wherever wild fruits of any species grow, improved
fruit of the same or cognate species may be successfully cultivated.
The indigenous flora of Minnesota, embraces apples, plums, cherries,
grapes, strawberries, raspberries, currants and gooseberries.
We may, therefore, successfully and profitably cultivate the improved
kinds of all these fruits. The conditions of success are
only these:&mdash;experience, knowledge and perseverance.</p>

<p>"All kinds of Siberian Crab apples, (which are valuable chiefly
for preserves,) including the improved Transcendant and Hyslop,
are perfectly adapted to our climate; and flourish in almost every
soil and situation where any other tree will grow, and also produce
great crops.</p>

<p>"At our State Fair at St. Paul, in October, 1871, there was
a magnificent display of home grown fruits, which would have
been creditable to any State in the West. Among the numerous
varieties of excellent fruit exhibited in large quantities were the
following:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Apples</span>.&mdash;Duchess of Oldenburg, Red Astracan, Saxton or
Fall Stripe, Plum Cider, Fameuse, Haas, Jefferson County, Perry
Russet, American Golden Russet, Yellow Bellflower, Ramsdale
Sweeting, Geniton, Lucy, Winona Chief, Jonathan, Price's Sweet,
Westfield, Seek no Further, Sap, Wagner, Winter Wine Tay,
English Golden Russet, Dominie, St. Lawrence, Pomme Gris, Ben
Davis, Sweet Pear, and about thirty other varieties."</p>

<p>Since the publication of the report of the railroad commissioner
as given above, showing 1978 miles of railroads in Minnesota;
there have been 216 miles built in 1877, and 350 miles in 1878&mdash;total,
2544 miles now operated in the State. In 1862, we had but
ten miles of railroad in Minnesota; in 1878, sixteen years afterwards,
two thousand five hundred and forty-four miles.</p>

<p>This past year, the St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad has extended its
line to the British Possessions in Manitoba, connecting with a
road there and giving us direct railroad communication with the
vast country lying north of us; while the Southern Minnesota, the
Hastings &amp; Dakota, the St. Cloud branch of the St. Paul &amp; Pacific,
are extending their lines, like arteries, through the heart of the
State. In much less than ten years, Minnesota will have the most
perfect railroad system on this continent.</p>

<p class="center">HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION LAW.</p>

<p>We are proud of the Homestead Law of Minnesota. The State
says to its citizen: you may be unfortunate, even culpably improvident,
nevertheless you and your family shall not be left
homeless or without means to enable you to retrieve past misfortunes
or faults.</p>

<p>The law reads&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That a homestead consisting of any quantity of land not exceeding
eighty acres, and the dwelling house thereon and its appurtenances, to be
selected by the owner thereof, and not included in any incorporated town,
city or village, or instead thereof, at the option of the owner, a quantity of
land not exceeding in amount one lot, being within an incorporated town,
city or village, and the dwelling house thereon and its appurtenances,
owned and occupied by any resident of this State, shall not be subject to
attachment, levy, or sale, upon any execution or any other process issuing
out of any court within this State. This section shall be deemed and construed
to exempt such homestead in the manner aforesaid during the time
it shall be occupied by the widow or minor child or children of any deceased
person who was, when living, entitled to the benefits of this act."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the State, in its bountiful protection, says to its citizen,
"You may be unfortunate, even blamably improvident, nevertheless
the State shall not allow you and yours to be thrown paupers
on the world. Your homestead is still left to you, a competency
at least."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>There are also reserved for the settler, free from all law processes,
all his household furniture up to the value of $300, 3 horses,
or in lieu 1 horse and yoke of oxen, 2 cows, 11 sheep, 3 hogs,
wagon, harness, and all his farming machinery and implements;
also a year's supply of family provisions or growing crops, and
fuel, and seed grain not exceeding 50 bushels each of wheat and
oats, 5 of potatoes, and one of corn, also mechanics' or miners'
tools, with $400 worth of stock-in-trade, and the library and
instruments of professional men.</p>

<p>This is the beneficent protection which the State throws around
the poor man's home. Yet there is one way in which he may forfeit
it.</p>

<p>Should he have the misfortune to mortgage his homestead the
law can no longer protect him; he is in the toils of the money
lender, and should poor crops or other set-backs come to him now,
there is every probability that he will lose his home.</p>

<p>We say to our settlers, avoid this fatal error, misfortune almost
always follows it; toil, slave, fast, rather than mortgage your
homestead.</p>

<p>We come now to a very important part of our work. Under
this head we have made several calculations, for the guidance of
the immigrant. They have been made with care, and are, we
think, as nearly correct as it is possible to make such calculations.
By a careful study of them the intending immigrant will learn</p>

<p class="center">
WHAT HE HAS TO DO WHEN HE HAS SECURED HIS LAND.<br />
<br />
THE VARIOUS MODES HE MAY TAKE TO OPEN HIS FARM.<br />
<br />
THE EXPENSES INCURRED BY EACH METHOD.<br />
<br />
THE EXPENSE OF LIVING UNTIL HIS FIRST CROP COMES IN.<br />
</p>

<p>These, with minor details, we have set forth in the following
calculations. They embrace the case of the poor man with a
small capital and the man with quite a respectable capital, who
may wish to put it in a bank that never fails, and in which he will
himself be the director and owner.</p>

warm and clean&mdash;much better than a cheap lodging in a city.</p>

<p>We will give the dimensions of the house as 16 × 18 ft., to be
built of single boards; these to be sodded on the outside to any
depth the owner may wish. In this way, he can have a house far
warmer than a poorly put up frame house, at the following cost:</p>

<p>This sum he will absolutely require to have when he arrives on
the land. To this, in his calculations, he must add his expenses
coming here.</p>

<p>Railroad fares from different points will be given in another
place.</p>

<p>We have not here made any calculations in regard to the
purchase of his land, in the first place because the lands are
different prices in different colonies, and secondly because most of
our settlers with small means, buy their farms on time, getting
very easy terms of payments. All information in this respect will
be found in its proper place, when we come to speak of our colonies.
It must be born in mind (and it may be as well said here as elsewhere)
that the Catholic Bureau owns no lands; we but control
them and hold them at their original prices for our immigrants.
We have also secured advantages in prices and terms of payment
which immigrants cannot get outside of our colonies.</p>

<p>Now having no crop the first year, he works out in the harvest
and earns $60.00.</p>

<p>This he requires now, and more when he puts in his first crop,

charges, we will not charge them to his original capital.</p>

<p>Adding to this the sixty dollars the man earned the first harvest,

<p>It must be borne in mind that the settler has supported himself

his farm opened, and at least $300 added to the value of his land.

<p>Now, the expense of breaking, by right, should not be charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to the first crop, for it is a permanent value, added to the value of
the land, and should be calculated as capital: 50 acres broken on a
farm of a 160, adds fully $2 an acre to the value of the property.</p>

<p>But in the above calculation, we have not alone charged the
first crop with the breaking expenses, but also with the cash price
of every dollar's worth of labor expended, until the wheat is in
the railroad elevator, and the owner has nothing more to do,
unless to receive his money for it; and yet there is a clear profit
over all expenses of $535.00.</p>

<p>In making these calculations, it is necessary to put a certain
value on the wheat per bushel, and to allow for a certain amount
of bushels to the acre, but it will be obvious to any reader that in
both these important items there are continual variations.</p>

<p>The calculations we now give appeared in the edition of our
pamphlet for 1877, and were based, in a measure, on our fine
wheat crop for that year.</p>

<p>The crop of 1878, as we have already stated, fell short of 1877,
and were we basing our estimate on it we should calculate wheat
second grade at 66 cents per bushel, but the crop of 1879 may
surpass the crop of 1877; taking the average of many years' crops
and prices, our calculations are as near correct as they can be
made.</p>


<p class="center">SECOND CALCULATION OF HOUSE BUILDING.</p>

<p>In our calculation of the smallest sum a man would require,
coming to settle on the land, we made an estimate of a very cheap
house indeed, nevertheless one that can be made warmer than
many a more expensive one. We give an estimate of the cost of
a frame house 16×24, a story and a half high, with a T addition,
and a cellar 12 by 16.</p>

<p>We give the exact expenses of a house of this kind as it stands
at present in one of our colonies. It has three rooms up stairs
with a hall, two rooms down stairs with a hall and pantry, and
has had one coat of plaster:</p>

<table style="min-width: 40%;" summary="expenses">
<tr><td>Material for house                                       </td><td class="tdr">$280</td></tr>
<tr><td>Work                                                      </td><td class="tdr"> 75</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 4em;">Total</td><td class="bt tdr"> $355</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A man himself helping, can lessen this item for work, say $25,
leaving the cost of the house $330.</p>

<p>In our first calculation we put down as the lowest sum a man
would require to have after his arrival on the land, $409.75. But
in this calculation we gave him a house, such as it was, for $38.75.
Now, if he wants the better house we have just described, his
capital should be $726.</p>

<p class="center">WHAT A MAN WITH MODERATE CAPITAL CAN DO.</p>

wishes to start with a complete outfit of farming machinery, &amp;c.

come under the head of capital; we have charged it with what
will work the farm for years, and help to produce successive crops,
not of one hundred acres, but of two or three hundred acres; and
yet, with all the charges, the crop shows a profit of $773.</p>

<p>What other business can make such a showing as this?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, all the ready money the settler will require
to provide himself with machinery, will be ten per cent. on the
price; for the balance he will get two years time at 12 per cent.

<h2><a name="GENERAL_REMARKS" id="GENERAL_REMARKS">GENERAL REMARKS.</a></h2>


<p>While our figures and illustrations in regard to the opening of
a farm, and the expenses attending thereon, have been as explicit
and full as our space would permit, still we regard them but as a
basis for a variety of similar calculations to be made by intending
immigrants.</p>

<p>For instance, two friends might buy a breaking team between
them, and break, say twenty acres, on each one's farm. One could
do the breaking, while the other might be doing some other work.</p>

<p>In fact, each man's case has its own peculiar features, which he
must bring his own judgment to bear upon, and we don't pretend
to have done more than to have given him a good guide to assist
him in his calculations.</p>

<p>Twenty acres would be a pretty fair breaking for a poor man
the first year, and quite sufficient to enable him to support a small
family. We have farmers in the woods, now prosperous men,
who for years had not more than from five to ten acres cleared,
for it is hard work to clear heavy timbered land, and much easier
to plant young trees than to cut old ones down. But heretofore
poor men were frequently deterred from going on prairie land on
account of the heavy expense attached to fencing their tillage
land. This was about the highest item of expense. It is not
so now, for in the counties in which our Catholic colonies are
situated, and in the adjoining counties,</p>


<p class="center">A HERD LAW</p>

<p>is in force, whereby cattle have to be herded during the day, and
confined within bounds during the night. In this way one man
or boy can herd the cattle of a whole settlement, and the heavy,
vexatious and continual tax of fencing is entirely done away with.</p>

<p>All the lands in our Catholic colonies are prairie lands, and in
the colonies and adjoining counties, as we have already stated, the
herd law is in full force.</p>

<p>No one, at the present day, who has any experience in farming
in the West, would settle on an unimproved timber farm. It
takes a lifetime to clear such a farm, and even then a man leaves
some stumps for his grandchildren to take out. But we earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
impress upon our settlers the necessity of setting out trees around
their prairie homes. The rapid growth of trees set out on any of
our prairies, is absolutely wonderful. In six years after planting, a
man will have nice, sheltering, young groves, around his house.
One of the first things a settler should do after breaking up his
land is to set out some young trees, which he can buy very cheap.
All our railroads carry such freight free. If he cannot get the
trees he can sow the seed, which will do as well.</p>

<p>For comfort on a prairie, trees are a necessity; but it is worse
than useless, it is loss of time, to set them out, unless they are
taken care of: give them solitude, and keep the weeds and cattle
from them for a little while, and they will soon be able to take care
of themselves. Cord-wood can be bought at any of the railroad
stations in our colonies at an average of about five dollars a cord.</p>

<p>There is another matter which may well come under the head
of general remarks.</p>

<p>While we have shown by figures the good profits which may be
calculated upon by an industrious farmer, still, he must not look
for a great increase of money capital, for some years at least.</p>

<p>While he will be enabled under God, by industry, sobriety and
perseverance to give his family a good, comfortable living, it must
be to the increase in the value of his farm each year, that he must
look for an increase of capital, to that and the increase of his</p>


<p class="center">LIVE STOCK.</p>

<p>Above all things, he must attend to the latter; it is almost
incredible the way young stock will increase. A man starting
with one cow will have his yard full of young stock in a few years
by raising the calves that come to him.</p>

<p>It is a fact that men who came to this State without any means
whatever, and settled on land, are to-day among our most prosperous
farmers; but they came uninvited, at their own risk, and if
they had failed, they could only blame themselves.</p>

<p>The case is altogether different in regard to persons coming to
our Catholic colonies. They come invited, and depending upon
the information we give to them; therefore, there must be no misunderstanding
on either side.</p>

<p>We say to the immigrant, with the capital we have specified,
you can open a farm in Minnesota, and if you are industrious,
brave and hopeful, we promise you, under God, an independent
home. If you come without this capital, you do so at your own
risk.</p>

<p>We now come to speak of our Catholic Colonies. In doing so
we will be as accurate and as truthful as it is possible to be. At the
same time we recognize the difficulty of making others see things
as we see them, they are too apt to draw imaginary pictures from
our facts. For instance when we speak of settled communities
and towns, it should be borne in mind that our oldest settlement
was only opened in the spring of 1876, our two latest in the spring
of 1878, and that both farms and towns exhibit the rough,
unfinished appearance of new places in the West, which it takes
time, perseverance and industry to mould into thrifty comeliness;
with the aid of the two latter (perseverance and industry) the
former (time) will be but a very short period indeed. We have
now four Catholic Colonies in Minnesota, two in the western and
two in the southwestern part of the State.</p>

<h2><a name="SWIFT_COUNTY_COLONY" id="SWIFT_COUNTY_COLONY">SWIFT COUNTY COLONY.</a></h2>


<p>This is the oldest and doubtless best known of our colonies.
The colony lands commence 120 miles west of St. Paul and extend
for 30 miles on each side of the St. Paul and Pacific railroad. Within
the bounds of the colony are four railroad towns, one of them,
Benson, being the county seat; but the two colony towns proper,
are De Graff and Clontarf, being organized and run, as they say
out West, by our own people.</p>

<p>In fact, Swift County Colony may very well be spoken of as two
colonies, for the present under one name, the Chippewa River
dividing the colony lands about in the center, having De Graff on
the east and Clontarf on the west. Each town too, has its own
Catholic church, congregation and resident priest&mdash;the Rev. F. J.
Swift, pastor at De Graff, and the Rev. A. Oster, pastor at Clontarf.</p>

<p>The colony lands on the east side of the Chippewa, stretch out
from the town of De Graff, 18 miles in length and 12 miles in
width, and Clontarf lands on the west side of the river, have equal
proportions.</p>

<p>This division and explanation may be of service to correspondents,
some of whom frequently write to one or other of the
resident priests, for information, in preference to writing direct
to the Catholic Bureau, in St. Paul.</p>

<p>When Bishop Ireland in 1876, got control of the unsold railroad
lands within the present bounds of Swift County Colony, there was
a large quantity of Government lands lying beside these railroad
lands, and open for homestead and pre-emption entries, so that a
great number of our people were able to secure farms of 80 and
160 acres by merely paying the fees of the U. S. Land Office.</p>

<p>Early settlers too, on the railroad lands, had an opportunity by
paying cash to get their farms much below the market value, for
the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company (the owner) having
fallen behind hand in paying the interest on its bonds held by
foreign capitalists, these bonds became depreciated in the market,
but were, nevertheless, good for their full amount, in payment of
the lands belonging to the company.</p>

<p>In this way we were enabled in the first edition of our pamphlet
for the year 1877, to offer lands, much below, in some instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
more than half below, their average value; but as prices depend
altogether on the market value of the bonds, a value which is always
fluctuating, we deem it unwise to bind ourselves to arbitrary
prices. The average railroad price of lands in Swift County
Colony is $6.50 per acre; the actual cash price, by buying bonds and
paying for the land with same, will be much less than this, and
we will, when called upon get the bonds for the immigrant at
their then value, but what the exact prices of the bonds may be
or how long they will remain in the market available for the
purchase of land, we cannot take upon ourselves to say.</p>

<p>In this connection we wish to point out to immigrants, that irrespective
of paying for land in bonds, for which they must pay
cash, they can make contracts, on long time, with the company,
for their farms.</p>

<p>There are other ways too by which our people can make homes
in this well-settled colony. Non-Catholics who were settled in
the county before the colony was established, will be willing to
sell out. Homesteaders, too, who got their land free from the
government, and made improvements, are frequently anxious to
realize a little capital by the sale of those improved farms, and go
still farther west. There is also a large quantity of school and
State lands in the county, which will be in the market in 1879;
so notwithstanding that the greater part of the colony railroad
lands have passed from the control of the Bureau into the possession
of settlers, and that all the government lands have been
taken up, we look forward, with pleasure, to see many more of
our people settling in Swift county next spring. They will find a
goodly number of their co-religionists settled before them and
anxious to give them a friendly welcome. There are very few of the
New England or Middle States that have not representatives in
the colony.</p>

<p>From a communication received from the Register of the United
States Land Office at Benson, the county seat, we find that since
the Bureau opened this colony in 1876, 425 Catholic settlers
have taken up government land in the colony; of these, 300 families
were Irish, the remainder Germans, Poles and French. About
an equal number of Catholics&mdash;a large majority Irish&mdash;have taken
railroad lands&mdash;80,000 acres of which have been sold; so that we
can claim at least 800 Catholic settlers, with their families, in
Swift County Colony at the present writing. Driving west from
De Graff to Clontarf, seventeen miles, and still eleven miles farther
west from Clontarf to the <i>Pomme de Terre</i> River, one is never out
of sight of a settler's house; and some of those farm houses would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
be a credit to a much older settlement, for we have settlers who
farm as much as five hundred acres, while others again farm but
eighty acres. The general quality of the soil is a dark loam,
slightly mixed with sand and with a clay sub-soil, admirably adapted
for wheat, oats, &amp;c., &amp;c., while the bountiful supply of good water
and the large quantity of natural meadow lands, scattered all over
the colony&mdash;there is scarcely a quarter section (160 acres) without
its patch of natural meadow&mdash;give the settler an opportunity to
combine stock raising and tillage on his farm.</p>

<p>The village or town of De Graff has a railroad depot and telegraph
office; a grain elevator, with steam power&mdash;which is the same as
saying, a cash market for all farm produce&mdash;six or seven stores,
with the general merchandise found in a country town; lumber
yard, machine warehouse, blacksmith, carpenter and wagon maker
shops; an immigrant house, where persons in search of land can
lodge their families until they are suited; a resident doctor, and
resident priest, Rev. F. J. Swift; a fine commodious church; a
handsome school house and pastor's residence. No saloon. The
business men of the town are our own people, and a Catholic fair,
for the benefit of the new church, held last fall, and patronized
exclusively by the colonists, netted $1,000 clear.</p>

<p>Traveling along the railroad and passing through Benson,
half way between De Graff and Clontarf, we come to the latter, the
youngest town in this young settlement, but it has a very fine
class of settlers around it: west of the village the land is as fine
as any in the State, known as the Hancock Ridge.</p>

<p>Clontarf has two general stores, a grain elevator, an immigrant
house, a railroad depot, blacksmith shop, a large church and a
very handsome residence for the priest, the Rev. A. Oster. No
part of the colony is settling up more rapidly than the portion
around Clontarf and several new buildings will go up in the
village next summer. Swift County Colony is fast beginning to
wear the features of a settled community. Many of our farmers
have harvested this year their second crop; our merchants report
that they are doing a lively business; bridges are being built,
roads laid out, plans of improvement discussed by the settlers; and
we challenge any part of the West to produce a more intelligent
rural class.</p>

<p>True to the memory of the old land and their love for their
church, the settlers have given familiar names to many of the
townships in the colony, such as Kildare, Cashel, Dublin, Clontarf,
Tara, St. Michaels, St. Josephs, St. Francis, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, running through the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
length of the colony, has, by its late extension, become one of the
great railroad thoroughfares of the northwest, and added much
to the value of the colony lands. Commencing at St. Paul, the
capital of Minnesota, it crosses the Northern Pacific at Glyndon in
this State and continues on to St. Vincent, situated on the line
separating the State of Minnesota and the British Possessions in
Manitoba. Here it connects with a railroad just completed and
running to Winnipeg, the capital of the British province of
Manitoba.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="GRACEVILLE_COLONY" id="GRACEVILLE_COLONY">GRACEVILLE COLONY.</a></h2>


<p>This colony is located in Big Stone County, west of Swift. It
is our Homestead Colony, and one which we feel very proud of.
What is thought of Big Stone County by Western men, in connection
with stock raising, is shown by the following extract from
a published communication.</p>

<p>"Stock raising now receives more attention from the prairie
farmers than ever before, since the erroneous impression heretofore
existing that the wintering of cattle was too expensive, has
been entirely disproved. Numbers of settlers from the lower part
of our State, and from Iowa, have removed to Big Stone County
with large droves of cattle, that they herd on the vast natural
meadows of that county, which also furnish all the necessary hay
for winter food." We will add to this, that the soil of Big Stone
County, for agricultural purposes, is deemed as good as any in the
State, without exception.</p>

<p>The lands in the county being government lands, we could not
of course have any control of them, they were open to all comers;
but by prompt action the Bureau located during the months of
March, April and May, one hundred and seventy-five families in
the county. Many of those colonists were poor people who were
induced to leave Minnesota towns and settle on land.</p>

<p>But we will let a resident of the colony, one who has examined
every quarter section in it and materially aided in its settlement,
speak for it.</p>

<p>In answer to a letter from us, Col. J. R. King, a resident of
Graceville, and a practical surveyor, who has acted as agent for the
Bureau since the opening of the colony, writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"During the months of March and April, 1878, a great number
of claims for our people were entered in the United States Land
Office, but before any of them come on to their lands, Bishop
Ireland shipped, in March, five car loads of lumber for erecting a
church building; the church was commenced the same month and
completed, in the rough, in about three weeks. This is the first
instance, in my knowledge, where a church was erected in advance
of settlement. Our Right Rev. Bishop must have had a foreknowledge
of what was to follow.</p>

<p>"In the short space of three months there was built, in a radius
of six miles from Graceville Church, over 150 comfortable cabins,
and on each claim from five to ten acres broken for a garden and
planted with potatoes, corn, beans, turnips, &amp;c., &amp;c., which yielded
quite a good supply for the present winter. Our colonists had the
advantage of being early on the ground and had their gardens
planted in May.</p>

<p>"The colonists broke during last summer from fifteen to thirty
acres per man, so that next spring they will be able to get in
wheat sufficient to carry them through the second winter handsomely.
They are all in the very best spirits and could not be
induced to return to the cities&mdash;for they already feel independent
and masters of the situation.</p>

<p>"The soil here is splendid and the country beautiful. Gently
rolling prairie, with numerous ponds or small lakes and plenty of
the finest hay.</p>

<p>"The balance of Big Stone County, outside of our colony, has
all been taken up; a large majority of the claims occupied and
substantial improvements made by the settlers, who are first class.
Traverse County, adjoining us on the north, is fast filling up.</p>

<p>"I must not forget to say that we have good water in abundance;
my own well is sixteen feet deep, with as fine, pure water as
ever was found.</p>

<p>"And now to tell you about our little village, Graceville, named
in honor of our revered Bishop, the Right Rev. Thos. L. Grace.
It is beautifully situated on the north shore of one of the two large
lakes known as Tokua Lakes, and has three general stores, one
hotel, one blacksmith and wagon shop, a very handsome little
church and the priest's residence attached. Around the lake is a
fine belt of timber which adds much to the beauty of the place. The
village is 26 miles due east from Morris, on the St. Paul &amp; Pacific
Railroad, but the Hastings &amp; Dakota Railroad, now built close to
the line, will run through our county next summer; by and by we
will have a cross road running through the colony lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our resident pastor is the Rev. A. V. Pelisson, a veteran missionary,
who is doing a wonderful deal of good, temporal and
spiritual, among his people, and is 'the right man in the right
place,' full of energy and zeal.</p>

<p>"The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is offered up in our church
every day, and on Sundays we have High Mass, for Graceville has a
sweet church choir.</p>

<p>"It is most edifying to see the crowd of men, women and
children who flock in from all points of the compass to church on
Sundays. Father Pelisson had the first temporary church taken
down and in its place he has erected one of the prettiest and
neatest churches in the State; a credit both to the good father
and his people who so cheerfully assisted in its erection, under
many difficulties.</p>

<p>"From the roof of the church I can count to-day over 70 houses
where last March there was nothing but a bare prairie. If God
prospers our people next season with good crops, they will be
over their difficulties, in a fair way to prosperity."</p>

<p>We do not know that we have anything to add to Col. King's
very graphic and truthful statement in regard to Graceville Colony
and the prospects of its settlers, very many of whom were so poor
when they went in, that it required Western pluck to face the
prairie. The building of the Hastings &amp; Dakota Railroad last
summer, giving them employment, was a great help.</p>

<p>No doubt they had and will have a rough time of it for a little
longer, but, they are toiling with hope, with the hope of an honest
independence in the future. And with this hope in his heart, the
settler toils and feels himself "every inch a man."</p>

<p>Traverse County, mentioned in Col. King's letter, has, at the
present writing, a large quantity of government land open to
homestead and pre-emption entries. (See the Homestead Law in
another place.) There is no doubt too, but that persons, during
the land excitement last year, made government claims in Big
Stone County&mdash;some within the colony bounds&mdash;which, from one
cause or another, they will neglect to hold, by not fulfilling the
conditions required by the law governing such claims. In all
cases of the kind the lands revert to the government and are again
subject to entry. Yet, so rapidly are those lands taken up that
we cannot promise to our people, coming from the East, that
when they arrive, they will find any homestead land adjoining or
within any of our colonies.</p>

<h2><a name="ST_ADRIAN_COLONY" id="ST_ADRIAN_COLONY">ST. ADRIAN COLONY.</a></h2>


<p>This colony, situated in Nobles County, in the southwestern
portion of the State, close to the State line of Iowa, on the
Luverne and Sioux Falls branch of the Sioux City and St. Paul
Railroad, was opened in September, 1877.</p>

<p>Before going into details in regard to the colony we will give
some extracts from an article (lately published) treating of southwestern
Minnesota, where, as we have stated, St. Adrian colony
is located.</p>

<p>"Southwestern Minnesota has made rapid progress in stock
raising. As capital increases, and the utility and profit of stock
raising become better understood by the farmer, we shall see
fine flocks and herds, in addition to the fields of waving grain,
and our rich prairies teeming with the life they can so amply
sustain. The abundance of clear, sweet water, dry atmosphere,
its elevation, rich pasturage, freedom from disease, and direct and
ready access to all the prominent markets, unite to make Minnesota
the paradise of stock raisers. Good hay can be put in the
stack in Southwestern Minnesota for $1.25 per ton. It can be
secured without other expense than cutting, and with very little
labor, enough can be made for the maintenance of a large amount
of stock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"This section has been settled but seven years, yet it is already
teeming with a population of wide-awake, industrious people,
whose fields are evidences of the innate wealth of the region.
The soil of Southwestern Minnesota is adapted to the successful
cultivation of grain, and so celebrated has its grain producing
qualities become, that capitalists have put their money into large
tracts of land, and have now immense fields under cultivation,
and their investments have proven extremely profitable. There
are farms of 600, 1,000 and 2,000 acres, all producing Minnesota's
great staple, wheat. Every year, as the success of these investments
becomes known, new and large farms are opening.</p>

<p>"Southwestern Minnesota is on the move, and to those who wish
to locate in a thriving, driving, pushing, growing country, no
locality on the green earth promises more faithfully, and none
will redeem its pledges with greater pride to the wide-awake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
stirring husbandman. The very soil teams with wealth, and the
air is laden with the most precious gifts of health."</p>

<p>Making allowance for the rather high coloring of the above
extracts, its facts are correct. Southwestern Minnesota has many
advantages for stock raising, its soil is good, none better. Stock
raising has been carried on successfully there to the advantage of
a great many poor settlers, and men of wealth have opened large
grain farms in this section of the State; the largest of these farms
adjoins the colony lands of St. Adrian.</p>

<p>Of the 70,000 acres of railroad land which Bishop Ireland holds
the control of for colony purposes, 22,000 acres have been sold to
settlers.</p>

<p>The colony lands adjoin the railroad town of Adrian. A little
over a year ago it had three houses, now it is one of the brightest,
liveliest, most bustling little burgs in Southwestern Minnesota.
But, as in the case of Graceville, we will let a resident of St. Adrian
speak for the town and colony. The following is an extract from
a letter which we received the other day from the Rev. C. J. Knauf,
the pastor in charge of the St. Adrian colony.</p>

<p>Father Knauf resides in the town of Adrian&mdash;where immigrants,
bound for the colony, leave the train&mdash;and takes an active
part in locating immigrants. Father Knauf writes:</p>

<p>"The village of Adrian consisted of three houses when I came
here, September 20, 1877, one year and three months ago to-morrow;
now there are 68 houses in the village. We have three hotels,
one restaurant (no beer,) three lumber yards, one steam feed mill,
four general stores, one drug, two hardware stores, one jewelry
store, one barber shop, one large livery stable, two furniture dealers,
four dealers in farming machinery, one shoe maker, one tailor,
three blacksmiths, one carpenter shop, four wheat and produce
buyers; a public school house, costing $1,800; a Catholic Church,
well finished, and the pastor's house, the latter costing $1,840.</p>

<p>"I sold, up to date, 22,000 acres of land. Thousands of acres
were broken last season. I was the first Catholic to arrive here:
now we have sixty Catholic families in the colony. Next spring
we will have 160 Catholic families, for a great many bought farms
last year, had breaking done&mdash;some broke extensively, others moderately&mdash;and
will move on, with their families, to their new farms,
next spring, in time to put in their first crop."</p>

<p>In explanation of that portion of Father Knauf's letter which
speaks of parties who have purchased farms in the colony but who
have not moved on to them as yet, we will say, that since the
Bureau, at the solicitation of many correspondents, agreed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
land selected and contracts made out for persons anxious to secure
land in some one of our colonies, and yet unable, from one cause
or another, to come on immediately; a great many have adopted
this mode to get land.</p>

<p>We find from Father Knauf's letter that he has on his books
the names of one hundred families who have secured land in St.
Adrian colony, and will move on to their new homes next spring,
so that he is looking forward to very lively times.</p>

<p>There is also coming out to St. Adrian Colony in the spring a
brave-hearted little lady from Brooklyn, N. Y., to get in her first
crop, and put up her first farm house. She was on here last summer,
spent a month or so at St. Adrian, bought 270 acres of land,
left money to pay for the breaking of 200 acres, and will come on
to settle in the spring. She has no doubt but that she will make
the venture pay, and prefers to make the trial rather than have
her money bearing small interest in the East.</p>

<p>Lands sell in the colony from $5 to $7.50 per acre. A discount
of 20 per cent. from these prices is allowed for cash. The conditions
for time contracts are as follows: At time of purchase,
one-tenth of principal and interest on unpaid principal; second
year, interest only; third year one-fourth of remaining principal
and interest on unpaid principal; same for three ensuing years:
after the expiration of which the full price of the land is paid.</p>

<p>As an instance, showing the value set on land in this part of
Minnesota, we will state, that school lands, sold last spring, at
public sale, in the neighborhood of St. Adrian, brought from $7.50
to $17 per acre: the price obtained heretofore having been $5 per
acre.</p>

<p>On stepping from the train at St. Adrian, last summer, one witnessed
a scene of bustle and activity similar to those frequently
described by writers in sketches of Western life in new settlements,
with some important exceptions, for neither in Adrian nor
in any of the towns under the control of the Catholic Bureau,
can there be found rowdies, nor the saloons that vomit them forth.
This fact may take from the dramatic effect of such sketches, but
it is the anchor of family unity and love, the harbinger of prosperity.</p>

<p>The town of Adrian is 197 miles from St. Paul. A daily train
from St. Paul to Sioux Falls, D. T., passes through it; it has also
railroad communication with Sioux City, Iowa.</p>

<p>The lands of the colony are first-class, both for agriculture and
stock raising: and to those of fair capital we strongly recommend
St. Adrian Colony.</p>

<p>The colonists are German and Irish Catholics.</p>

<h2><a name="AVOCA_COLONY" id="AVOCA_COLONY">AVOCA COLONY.</a></h2>


<p>This is the latest opened of our colonies, Bishop Ireland having
only secured control of the lands last April. It is situated in
Murray County (Southwestern Minnesota,) adjoining Nobles
County on the north, and in the whole 52,000 acres of land secured
by the Bishop for the colony, we very much doubt if one poor
section (640 acres) could be found, nor do we suppose that any of
the land will remain unsold by the 1st of next July.</p>

<p>While the beauty of the location and fertility of the soil, make
Avoca one of the most desirable locations in Minnesota, the easy
terms on which a farm can be secured, are additional and
substantial advantages for men of small means.</p>

<p>The centre of the colony&mdash;the village of Avoca, situated on a
beautiful lake&mdash;is just twenty miles from Heron Lake, a station
on the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad, 160 miles southwest of
St. Paul; but the Southern Minnesota Railroad, which will give
this portion of the State a direct communication with the Milwaukee
and Chicago markets, is now completed to within forty-five
miles of Avoca, and we expect to see it running through our
colony lands by next fall. This will give to the settlers in Avoca
Colony, a direct southern route to Chicago, and a choice of markets
for their produce: the latter an advantage which farmers can well
appreciate.</p>

<p>The price of lands in the colony are from $5 to $6.50 per acre,
on the following easy terms of payment. At the time of purchase,
interest only, one year in advance, seven per cent., is required; at
the end of one year, interest only for another year; at the end of
two years, one-tenth of the principal, and a year's interest on the
balance; at the end of three years, one-tenth of the principal, and
interest on balance; at the end of each year thereafter, twenty
per cent. of the principal, and interest on balance; until all is paid.</p>

<p>We subjoin a practical illustration of these terms:</p>

<p>We will say that January, 1879, a man contracts for 80
acres of land at $5 per acre, this will come to $400, with 7 per
cent. interest, which sums he will have to pay as follows:</p>

<p>The advantage of the terms is, that the principal payments are
all postponed until the farmer has had time to raise several crops
from his land. A quarter-section of land will support a family,
pay for itself, leave after seven years a balance in cash, and be
worth more than twice its original value.</p>

<p>We have already selected several 80 and 160 acre farms in Avoca
for persons not in a position to come on immediately to the land.
Now let us explain how this operates.</p>

<p>An intending immigrant writes to the Bureau to have 80 acres
of land in Avoca at $5 per acre, selected for him, (as a general rule
a man should take a quarter-section, 160 acres, by doing so he
will be likely to have both meadow and tillage land on his farm.)
For those 80 acres, he pays down, before getting his contract from
the railroad company, one year's interest, $28. He writes on
then, next spring, to the Bureau, to have 30 acres of his land broken
and ready for a crop the following spring&mdash;1880. His breaking
will cost at $2.50 per acre, $75. He will have paid the first year
$103, and have his land ready for the seed; he comes on then the
second spring, 1880, pays $28, another year's interest, to the railroad
company, puts in his crop and has it saved and ready for
market in August. Up to this time&mdash;not calculating the expenses
chargeable to the crop, which we have estimated already in another
place&mdash;he has paid out $131, and has his farm opened and in a fair
way to pay for itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>In soil and location the Colony of Avoca is not surpassed in the
Northwest. Nine miles from the village of Avoca there is a large
body of timber. Settlers can also get coal from Iowa.</p>

<p>The Rev. Chas. K&oelig;berl is pastor of the colony, address, Avoca,
Murray County, Minnesota. He writes to us under date of December
20th, 1878:</p>

<p>"In regard to this colony it promises, thank God, to be a great
success. Since June, when the land sales commenced, we have
sold 9,850 acres, and forty-five Catholic families are preparing
to move into the colony next spring. Immigrants will have in
our village of Avoca, a building where they can leave their families
until they have put up their houses, also a boarding house and
store.</p>

<p>"In speaking of our climate you can boast honestly of its health.
Among 200 families belonging to my missionary district, I have
not known of one case of internal disease, during my seven
months' stay here. It would be well to particularly mention in
your forthcoming pamphlet, that this is a prairie, not a timber
county. I receive so many letters asking about the cost of
clearings, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I expect quite a rush for land in Avoca, next spring, and will be
glad if our people come on early, in time to plant potatoes, corn, &amp;c."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In bringing this brief review of our Catholic colonies to a close,
we again thank the Catholic press of this country, for its honest
advocacy of Catholic immigration to the land. The favorable
notices its editors have given to our humble labors in our own
field of duty, and the service rendered to our work thereby, can
never be forgotten by us.</p>

<p>Our friend, P. Hickey, Esq., editor of the <i>Catholic Review</i>, came
specially from New York, last summer to visit our colonies, to
judge for himself; and what he saw, the favorable impressions he
carried away with him, together with sound argument in favor of
Catholic colonization, have appeared, from time to time, since his
return, in able and lucid articles from his pen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>God has blessed our labors beyond our expectations. We see
our colonies fast merging into settled communities, where honest
labor goes hand in hand with religion, and where men work not
for a mere pittance from a master's hand, to support them for a
day or a week, but with the hope, the prospect, of an inheritance
for their children, in the future.</p>

<p class="center">WHERE TO CALL IN ST. PAUL.</p>

<p>Decidedly the best time for the emigrant to come to Minnesota
is the spring. If possible, he should not arrive later than the first
week in May. He should have his land selected in time to commence
to break for garden stuff and corn about the 20th of May,
then he can continue to break, for his next year's wheat crop, up
to the early part of July.</p>

<p>The month of June is the month for breaking, for then the grass
is young and succulent, and will rot readily. A man coming in
the early part of June can have land broken for his next year's
crop, but he loses the advantages of garden stuff and sod corn to
help him out in his living until his first crop comes in.</p>


<p class="center">WHAT TO BRING.</p>

<p>All your bedding that is of value. All your bedclothes. All
wearing apparel, good clothing of every description: nothing
more. Do not think of bringing stoves, nor any kind of house
furniture. You can get all such at the stores in the colonies, or
here in St. Paul, new, for nearly what the freight on your old furniture,
worthless and broken, perhaps, by the time it arrived here,
would come to. The better way is to sell what you have in this
line, before leaving, and buy here.</p>

<h2><a name="A_CHAPTER_FOR_ALL_TO_READ" id="A_CHAPTER_FOR_ALL_TO_READ">A CHAPTER FOR ALL TO READ.</a></h2>


<p>We wish that this concluding chapter of our pamphlet may be
read carefully, and thought well over by intending immigrants.</p>

<p>We wish it for their benefit, and our own benefit and protection.
It is, we might say, a fearful responsibility to advise another in a
matter which contemplates a change in his habits, mode of life,
and home, and such a change should never be undertaken, especially
by a man of family, without a most thorough investigation,
not alone as to the place he intends going to, but likewise as to his
own fitness for the change.</p>

<p>When you have examined this pamphlet from cover to cover,
then commence an examination of yourself, not forgetting your
wife, if you have one, who is part of you, and a very important
part in connection with this question of your going upon land.</p>

<p>This is especially necessary if you and your wife have lived for
years in a city and become habituated to city life. It is a great
change from city life in the East to country life in the West,
especially when the part of the country one moves to is new and
settlements just forming.</p>

<p>You are not to expect to realize the advantages of the change
right off; it is through yourself, through your own grit and industry,
those advantages must come.</p>

<p>To a Western farmer there is nothing bleak or lonely in a prairie;
to a man coming fresh from a city and looking on it, for the first
time, with city eyes, it may, very likely, seem both. Indeed, a
sense of loneliness akin to despondency is a feeling which the
newly-arrived immigrant has generally to contend against, a feeling
which may increase to a perfect scare if he is a man anxious
to consult Tom, Dick and Harry&mdash;who are always on hand&mdash;as to
the wisdom of the step he has just taken.</p>

<p>We speak from experience, from facts we have a personal knowledge
of. Our labors in the cause of immigration have brought to
us much happiness and some pain.</p>

<p>To illustrate: Two immigrants arrived here last year, in high
spirits, called at our office a few minutes after landing, and so
impatient were they to go hunt up land that they were quite disappointed
to find they would have to stop over one night in St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Paul. Well, the next morning they called at the office again, all
courage, all desire to go upon land wilted out of them, and informed
us that they had changed their minds and were going back to
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Why? Well, they had met a man at the boarding house they
stopped over night at, who advised them not to go out and settle
on a prairie. He told them, too, that "he was fifteen years in
Minnesota and never could get a dollar ahead."</p>

<p>Now here were men, rational to all appearance, having traveled
two thousand miles or so to settle upon land, when they came
within sight of the land, as we may say, losing all desire to visit
it, all courage, all confidence in disinterested, experienced friends,
and in the information they gave to them; in everything but the
word of a loafer, who never did a day's good in his life, nor never
will, and who was anxious to shuffle off the onus of his slipshod
condition from himself to the country.</p>

<p>Here is another case, which occurred a few months after Swift
Colony was opened and while the country around looked still wild
and lonely.</p>

<p>Two men arrived here from Philadelphia. They went on to the
Catholic colony in Swift County, and in a day or two returned,
saying that they had made up their minds to go back to Philadelphia.
Why? Did they not find everything as it was reported
to them? "Oh, yes, the land was good, and there was a good
chance for a poor man to make a home on it, if he could content
himself, but it was too lonely for them."</p>

<p>Lonely, to be sure it was; with the noise of the city still ringing
in their ears, with its crowds and its gaslights still in their eyes,
these men found the prairie lonely, and without pausing to consider
all the circumstances, they turned their back upon it.</p>

<p>They were both decent, intelligent men, and, had they remained,
taken land, gone to work, opened a farm, and seen their first crop
ripening, you could no more have got them back to Philadelphia
than you could get them into the penitentiary.</p>

<p>Now, we say to those for whose benefit this pamphlet has been
written, if you come here you must come fully prepared to feel the
effects of a great change. If you come from a city, you will,
doubtless, feel lonely for a while, until you get accustomed to
prairie life; you will miss many immediate comforts; you will have
to put up with discomforts, with disappointments, with trials.
The man who feels he can stand up against all such difficulties in
the present, and look bravely to the future for his reward, let him
come to Minnesota. The man who feels within him no such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
strength, who is easily disheartened and inclined to listen to the
idle talk of every man whom he meets, let him stop away and
listen; better to listen now, where you are, than after going to
the expense of coming here.</p>

<p>To the family man we say: We would much prefer that you
should come on here in the spring and see for yourself before
breaking up your present home and bringing on your family.</p>

<p>If you settle down, you can send or go for your family; if you
are not pleased with the change, there will not be much harm
done.</p>

<p>Another very important piece of advice we give to you: If your
wife is very much opposed to going upon land, do not come out.
A discontented wife on a new farm is far worse than the Colorado
beetle. But if she urges you to come, if, in this matter, she
thinks of your welfare and that of her children, rather than of
the society of the gossips she will leave behind her; if she says to
you, "we will have the children out of harm's way anyhow,"
then come with a brave heart and the smile of the true wife and
mother shall be as a sunbeam in your prairie home.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_SECURE_GOVERNMENT_LAND" id="HOW_TO_SECURE_GOVERNMENT_LAND">HOW TO SECURE GOVERNMENT LAND.</a></h2>


<p>Although we cannot promise government land in any of our
colonies, still we give the following synopsis of the laws affecting
such land, as likely to be of benefit to those who wish to secure
homes in this way.</p>


<p class="center">HOMESTEADS.</p>

<p>1. <i>Who may enter.</i>&mdash;First, every head of a family; second, every
single person, male or female, over the age of twenty-one years,
who are citizens of the United States, or have declared their intentions
to become such.</p>

<p>2. <i>Quantity that may be entered.</i>&mdash;80 acres within ten miles on
each side of a land-grant railroad, and 160 acres without.</p>

<p>3. <i>Cost of entry.</i>&mdash;Fourteen dollars.</p>

<p>4. <i>Time for settlement.</i>&mdash;After making his entry the settler has
six months within which to remove upon his land.</p>

<p>5. <i>Length of settlement.</i>&mdash;The settler must live upon and cultivate
his entry for five years. At any time after five, and within
seven years, he makes proof of residence and cultivation.</p>

<p>6. <i>Proof required.</i>&mdash;His own affidavit and the testimony of two
witnesses.</p>

<p>7. <i>Residence.</i>&mdash;Single, as well as married men, are required to
live upon their homesteads.</p>

<p>8. <i>Soldiers' Homesteads.</i>&mdash;Every honorable discharged soldier,
sailor or marine, who served for ninety days, can enter 160 acres
within railroad limits, upon payment of eighteen dollars. The
time spent in the service will be deducted from the five years' residence
required.</p>


<p class="center">TIMBER CULTURE ENTRY.</p>

<p>1. <i>Who may enter.</i>&mdash;The same qualifications are required as in
a homestead entry.</p>

<p>2. <i>Quantity that may be entered.</i>&mdash;40, 80, or 160 acres.</p>

<p>3. <i>Limitations.</i>&mdash;But one-fourth of any section can be entered.</p>

<p>4. <i>Requirements.</i>&mdash;No settlement is required. By the amended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
law only ten acres need be broken and set out in trees on 160
acres, (quarter section.)</p>

<p>First year, break five acres.</p>

<p>Second year, break five acres and cultivate in crop first year's
breaking.</p>

<p>Third year, set out trees in first five acres broken and crop
second five acres.</p>

<p>Fourth year, set out trees in latest five acres broken.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;Seed or cuttings can be put in in place of trees.</p>

<p>If the timber entry be but 80 acres, one-half the quantity
before given is planted; if 40 acres, one-fourth.</p>

<p>5. <i>Proof required.</i>&mdash;Affidavit of party, and testimony of two
witnesses.</p>

<p>6. <i>Cost of entry.</i>&mdash;Fourteen dollars for any entry, without regard
to quantity.</p>

<p>A man making a Homestead entry, is also entitled to make a
Timber-culture entry. This would give him, outside of the ten
miles railroad grant, half a section of land; a son or daughter,
twenty-one years of age, can also enter under the Homestead and
Timber-claim acts, half a section; and thus one family can secure
a whole section of land.</p>


<p class="center">PRE-EMPTION ACT.</p>

<p>Under this act, a man can enter 80 acres of government land,
inside the ten miles railroad limits, price $2.50 per acre; or 160
acres, outside the railroad grant, for which he will have to pay,
getting two years time $1.25, government price.</p>

<p>If he wishes, he can pay up in six months, on proof of actual
residence, having made the improvements on the land required
by the law, which are easily done, and get his title; having
secured this, he can then enter 80 or 160 acres more, under the
Homestead act. He cannot Pre-empt and Homestead at the same
time.</p>

<p>None of the government conditions for securing land are at
all burdensome to the actual settler; whether required by law or
not, to be a farmer, a man must live upon his land and cultivate it.</p>

<p class="center"><b>The Marsh Harvester and Harvester King, with or<br />
without their celebrated Automatic Crane Binder Attachment for 1879.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/3large.jpg"><img src="images/3.jpg" width="400" height="244" alt="Harvester" /></a>
</div>

<p>We present, on this page, a cut representing the latest improvements in grain-cutting
machinery, as shown in the celebrated <i>Marsh Harvester with Automatic Crane-Binder
Attachment</i>.</p>

<p>The Marsh Harvester itself is too widely and favorably known to require an extended
description or commendation. It was the first of this class of grain-harvesting machines, and,
indeed, for some years the only one, forcing itself into favor against the united opposition of
the various reaper manufacturers who are now so clamorous in praise of their imitation harvesters.
It also made practicable automatic grain binding. All attempts to put self-binding
attachments to other reapers proved futile, and have only been successful when attached to
harvesters cutting and elevating the grain, as is done by this harvester.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of the Marsh Harvester have been fully alive to the importance of
having a self-binding attachment to their harvesters that should be correspondingly for a
binder what their harvester is admitted to be&mdash;<i>the best of its class</i>. To this end they have had
skilled labor specially employed for several years, and have invented and patented several
important improvements and devices, and have bought others. They have also had their
binders in the grain fields for several years past, following the progress of the harvest from
Texas to Manitoba. Last season this binder did remarkable work. Such minor defects as
the most thorough tests and roughest usage developed have been carefully remedied.</p>

<p>It is no longer a question of success with this binder, success is a fully demonstrated fact.
Another thing will be obvious to all who carefully examine this binder, that it is very simple
and easily understood. This is an indispensible requisite to a successful machine.</p>

<p>Farmers are too busy and too much hurried in harvest time to study mechanics or tinker on
machinery. They want a machine they can put in the field, and do good work, without bother,
loss of time or undue perplexity. This harvester and binder will do good work with certainty.</p>

<p>The Marsh Harvester cuts a five-foot swath the King cuts six feet. All of these harvesters
are so made this year that a binder attachment can be put on at any time hereafter, so that
a farmer, desiring to divide the expense, can buy the harvester this year and the binder next.</p>

<p>Look at it! A few years ago it required six or seven men to do, with a self-rake reaper,
what the Marsh Harvester and Binder will do with one man or one boy. The Harvester also
does the work cleaner and better. It binds every straw, and saves enough in this way to
nearly or quite pay for the wire. The wire-bound bundles can be made as large or as small as
you like. The wire is unobjectionable in threshing, the wire passing through without injury
to the thresher. No cattle will eat wire, and no one has ever been known to be injured by it.
It requires about three pounds of wire to an acre of grain of average stand. This machine
reduces the cost and the labor of grain harvesting to a minimum. No progressive farmer can
afford to do his work with an old-fashioned reaper. He might almost as well return to the
hand sickle.</p>

<p>It is now a question of the best binder. <i>Thus far the manufacturers of the Marsh Harvester
have furnished the best harvester, and now they offer the best binder</i>, and still propose
to keep their machines in the lead, as they have been, and are now.</p>

<p>We also manufacture the old and reliable WARRIOR MOWER, admitted by all to be
one of the best mowers in use. Apply to the nearest agency or to Gammon &amp; Deering,
Chicago, Ill., for circulars containing full particulars in regard to those machines.</p>
